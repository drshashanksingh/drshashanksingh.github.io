## What is Cryptography?


- A very basic and classical goal of Cryptography is enabling secret communication between two parties, even in the presence of an adversary.
- In the early days (before 1960), this was achieved through various mathematical tricks and methods that were often not very scientific in nature.
- In contrast, modern cryptography is grounded in a solid mathematical foundation and is regarded as a branch of engineering that lies at the intersection of mathematics and computer science.
